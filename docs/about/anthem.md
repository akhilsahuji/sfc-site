### THE BELLS OF ST. FRANCIS

The bells of St. Francis ring out far and wide.  
Their chimes make our childhood so happy and bright  
They welcome us children to work and to play.  
They call us to duty, they call us to pray.  

Ch: O Bells of St. Francis, we hear you repeating.  
The dear song of gladness, of sweet memories,  
You tell us of striving, frank and fair dealing.  
You sing to us of Truth and love and Victory.  

In the school of St. Francis, we spend happy time  
We learn the fine arts and true Meaning of Life  
In the Church of St. Francis we find comfort and light  
To fight the good fight and to do what is right.
