## Foundation and Early Years (1894-1913)

### The Beginning
On **October 13, 1894**, St. Mary J. Patrick Brophy I.B.V.M. of Tara Hall Simla submitted an application for establishing a convent school near the church. This application was favorably received, and on **October 19, 1894**, a grant of 6 acres at No. 67 Jhansi Cantt was approved.

### Construction Phase (1895-1897)
Between 1895 and 1897, a building was erected on the granted site, with proprietorship rights carefully reserved. The vision was to create an institution that would serve the educational needs of the British Army families residing in Jhansi.

### School Opening (1898)
**St. Francis Convent School** was finally opened in **1898** and entrusted to Sisters Patricia and Teresa of the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The school's mission was to provide quality education to the children of British Army personnel stationed in Jhansi.

## The Era of Transformation (1913-1948)

### New Leadership (1913)
The beginnings were indeed humble and challenging. The two founding sisters had grown old and could no longer manage the institution effectively. On **April 1, 1913**, the proprietorship and management of the school were formally transferred to the Bishop of Allahabad under Fr. Patronus Gramigha, OFM Cap.

The congregation of the I.B.V.M. decided to take over operations, and **Rev. Mother Delphina** arrived with two sisters - **Sr. M. Pauline** and **Sr. M. Aventine** - to revitalize the institution.

### Humble New Beginnings
Upon their arrival, the sisters found:
- A single hall with dilapidated furniture
- The compound overgrown like a jungle
- Only **Rs. 100** in funds
- Just **thirteen pupils** enrolled
- They lived in the same railway bogie in which they had traveled

### The Work of Progress Begins
Mother Delphine and her team cheerfully shouldered the troubles and hardships. Through determination and perseverance, they began the remarkable transformation:

#### First Expansion
Mother Delphine managed to enlarge the school building by adding:
- A wing of several large and airy rooms on the right side
- Many smaller rooms for various purposes
- A large chapel open to the public
- A high flagged verandah surrounding the house
- A connecting corridor and flight of stairs to the original building

## Major Milestones

### 1923 - Silver Jubilee
The school celebrated its **Silver Jubilee**, marking 25 years of educational service to the community.

### 1927 - Significant Expansion
**May 7, 1927** marked a historic day with the impressive ceremony of blessing and opening of the Chapel and new Convent. This event was a testimony to the dogged courage and perseverance of the pioneers. The large assembly of guests drew a fitting analogy between St. Francis' Convent and "the smallest of all seeds which soon became a great tree and sheltered all the birds of the air."

### 1929 - Educational Recognition
When the congregation took charge of the Jhansi mission in 1929, the school had already achieved the **rank of Middle School**.

### 1935 - High School Status
After successfully standing the probation test, the school was elevated to **High School status** in 1935, marking a significant academic milestone.

### 1935-36 - Continued Growth
**Mother M. Immaculata** made additional extensions to the original building on the left side, further expanding the infrastructure.

### 1937-38 - Further Development
The new wing constructed by Mother Delphine was extended with additional rooms and a verandah.

### 1938 - Community Celebration
On **April 27, 1938**, the sisters, teachers, and pupils extended a hearty welcome to His Lordship the Bishop of Allahabad for the **Silver Jubilee celebration** of the congregation's stewardship. The Bishop celebrated Mass, administered Holy Communion, and concluded with benediction of the Blessed Sacrament, expressing keen appreciation for the pioneers' work and confidence in a fruitful future.

## Wartime Resilience (1939-1941)

### World War II Period
During the challenging period of **World War II**, **Mother M. Margarita Mary** demonstrated remarkable leadership:
- **1939-40**: Successfully re-roofed the verandah and constructed a cycle-shed
- **1941**: Completed the construction of a lunch-shed, finishing the present convent school structure

## Modern Era and Continued Excellence

### 1950 - ICSE Affiliation
The school became affiliated with the **Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE)**, enhancing academic standards and providing students with a comprehensive curriculum.

### 1980 - Infrastructure Modernization
The campus expanded with new science laboratories and library facilities to meet the growing educational demands of the modern era.

### 2000 - Digital Revolution
The school embraced technology by introducing computer education and digital learning tools, preparing students for the challenges of the 21st century.

### 2024 - Celebrating Excellence
Today, **St. Francis Convent Inter College** celebrates **126 years of educational excellence** (1898-2024), maintaining a **100% board result** record and carrying forward the legacy of dedication and academic achievement established by the pioneering sisters.
