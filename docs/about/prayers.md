# Prayers / Hymns

## Morning Prayer

I have come to Thee to take Thy touch before I begin my day.

1. Let Thy eyes rest upon my eyes for a while.  
2. Let me take to my work the assurance of Thy comradeship, my friend.  
3. Fill my mind with Thy music to last through the desert of noise.  
4. Let Thy love’s sunshine kiss the peaks of my thoughts and linger in my life’s valley where the harvest ripens.

## Our Father

Our Father who in heav'n above,  
Dost rule o'er land and skies:  
Thy children's love, Thy children's prayer  
Be pleasing in Thine eyes.

Our Father, may Thy holy Name  
Be blessed by ev’ry tongue;  
Thy kingdom come in every soul,  
Thy glory to prolong!

Our Father, give us every day  
The daily bread we need,  
And all our sins forgive us now  
As we forgive, we plead!

Our Father, do not let us fall  
In temptation’s hour of strife;  
O guard us from all evil here,  
Give us eternal life.

## Guardian Angel

1. Guardian angel, from Heaven so bright,  
   Watching beside me, to lead me aright,  
   Fold Thy wings round me, O guard me with love,  
   Softly sing songs to me of Heaven above.

   **Chorus:**  
   *Beautiful Angel, my guardian so mild,*  
   *Tenderly guide me, for I am Thy child.*

2. Angel so holy, whom God sends to me,  
   Sinful and lowly, my guardian to be;  
   Wilt Thou not cherish the child of Thy care?  
   Let me not perish, my trust is Thy prayer.

3. O may I never forget Thou art near;  
   But keep me ever in love and in fear.  
   Waking and sleeping, in labour and rest,  
   In Thy sweet keeping, for I am Thy child.

## Let Thy Love

**Refrain:**  
*Let Thy love play upon my voice and rest on my silence.*

1. Let it pass through my heart into all my movements.  
2. Let Thy love, like stars, shine in the darkness of my sleep and dawn in my awakening.  
3. Let it burn in the flame of my desires and flow in all currents of my own love.
