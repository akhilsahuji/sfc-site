## Admission

Admissions are taken in the Lower Kindergarten. Authentic Birth Certificate is a must. Date of Birth once recorded will not be changed.

Admissions to other classes, if any, require a transfer certificate and mark sheet from the last school attended.

Pupils from other states/boards will have to get their TC countersigned by the Inspector of schools.
