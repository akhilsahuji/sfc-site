A leader is someone who can see the invisible, believe in the unbelievable and achieve the impossible.
Dear SFCIANS,
I am honoured to serve as the Head Girl for the academic year 2024-25. As I reflect on my time at St. Francis' Convent Inter College, I am filled with gratitude for the opportunities and experiences I have had. I entered as a little girl and here I am wearing the crown of glory, responsibility and authority. It is a crown of service, a symbol of my commitment to this school, but this crown is not just mine to wear- it represents each one of us and the values we uphold together.
SFC has always been a place where students are encouraged to explore their passions and develop their talents. From academic pursuits to extracurricular activities, we have a fitting environment and wealth of resources to help us succeed.

As the crown of the student body, it is my role to lead with grace, to inspire with humility, to represent the spirit that binds us all and uphold the legacy of this prestigious institution.
I believe that it is our responsibility as students to create a positive and inclusive environment for everyone in our school community. So, this year, let us strive to wear our invisible crowns everyday- by being kind, by reaching out to help others and by giving our best in everything we do. Together, we can shine brighter, reach higher and preserve the values of our foundress - Mother Mary Ward.

With pride and best wishes,

Jaya Bhadoria  
Head Girl
