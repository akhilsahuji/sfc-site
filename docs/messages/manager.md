**“IT IS AN HONOUR TO WORK FOR GOD”**

*- Mary Ward*

Looking at our school today some might wonder what was its humble beginning like. The history of St. Francis’ Convent Inter College, Jhansi is the history of courage and missionary zeal of our sisters who took bold and careful steps for the development of the school. We offer a bouquet of gratitude to our pioneering sisters. Two Irish Missionaries started this school in the year 1898. After a few years the circumstances forced them to leave this place. Then in 1913 it was handed over to us. It is a Catholic Minority Institution under the management of the Congregation of Jesus founded by Venerable Mary Ward in 1609. We rejoice in the Lord, and with Mother Mary Ward – our foundress and St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of our school, we say ‘the Almighty has done great things for us. Holy is His name’.

In this age of Globalisation, survival without new learning is unthinkable. So we must never forget to encourage every effort of the children to improve their every act of generosity and honesty and celebrate even the smallest of achievements. Today’s students grow up with digital technology and this technology has changed the way they view knowledge and access information. The role of teachers as transformational leaders is to transform students. , creating in them positive attitude towards life, developing a new vision for a meaningful life. We have a talented, dedicated, caring team of staff, each of whom works very hard to ensure that the abilities of the children in our care are nurtured and carefully developed.
I pray to almighty that the school scales new heights in the coming years and shines in the galaxy of glory and fame. Let us look back with pride and move forward with enthusiasm. This website will give you an overall view of the school and a glimpse of the educational activities.

With all good wishes,

Sr. Digna CJ
