## Our Patron
Lord, make me an instrument of your peace.
Where there is hatred, let me sow love.
Where there is injury, pardon.
Where there is doubt faith.
Where there is despair hope,
Where there is darkness light, and Where there is sadness, joy.
O Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek
To be consoled as to console.
To be understood as to understand;
To be loved as to love.
For it is in giving that we receive.It is in pardoning that we are pardoned;
And it is in dying that we were born to Eternal Life.

**St. Francis of Assisi**
(Patron)


## Our Foundress
 Mary Ward was born in Yorkshire, England in 1585 at a time of severe persecution of Catholics. Despite the sufferings, loss of property and even death of dear ones, many of her friends, relatives, and acquaintances remained faithful to their religion. Brought up in such an atmosphere of heroism and self-sacrifice, Mary grew up to be a woman of deep faith, steely determination and unswerving loyalty to the Church.

**‚ÄúThere is no such difference between men and women that women may not do great things.‚Äù - Mary Ward**

### MANAGER'S MESSAGE

 **‚ÄúIT IS AN HONOUR TO WORK FOR GOD‚Äù**
Looking at our school today some might wonder what was its humble beginning like. The history of St. Francis‚Äô Convent Inter College, Jhansi is the history of courage and missionary zeal of our sisters who took bold and careful steps for the development of the school. We offer a bouquet of gratitude to our pioneering sisters. Two Irish Missionaries started this school in the year 1898. After a few years the circumstances forced them to leave this place. Then in 1913 it was handed over to us. It is a Catholic Minority Institution under the management of the Congregation of Jesus founded by Venerable Mary Ward in 1609.  

**Sr. Digna CJ  
(Manager)**

It is a crown of service, a symbol of my commitment to this school, but this crown is not just mine to wear- it represents each one of us and the values we uphold together.
